<h3>General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO if special data categories are processed according to Art. 9(1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>

In the context of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if it is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO in the transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.
<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
<h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h3>

IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21(1) DSGVO). IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING.

<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>

In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>

You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
<h3>Right to Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.

<h3>Cookies</h3>

Our websites use so-called “cookies.” Cookies are small data packages that do no harm to your device.

Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion occurs through your web browser.

Cookies can be first-party cookies (set by us) or third-party cookies (set by third-party companies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services provided by third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).

Cookies serve various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies may be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.

Cookies necessary for the electronic communication process, the provision of certain functions you desire (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or the optimization of the website (e.g., cookies for measuring web audience) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent for the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, processing is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO and § 25(1) TTDSG); the consent can be revoked at any time.

You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.

<h3>Contact</h3>

If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time. The data you send to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - especially legal retention periods - remain unaffected.
